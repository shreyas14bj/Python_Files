# 📝 CLI Task Manager with Emoji Categorization

A Python-based command-line tool to manage your daily tasks with an intuitive categorization system using emojis. Quickly add, search, and delete tasks based on categories — all in a beautiful terminal interface.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Add Tasks**: Enter tasks and get them automatically categorized.
- 🧠 **Smart Categorization**: Uses keywords to group tasks with relevant emojis.
- 🔍 **Search Tasks**: Find tasks by keyword or category.
- 🗑️ **Delete by Category**: Remove all tasks under a specific category with one command.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: Saves tasks to `to-do.txt`.
- ✨ **Colorful Terminal UI** using `colorama`.

🗂 to-do.txt is the task storage file automatically created by the program during runtime.
All added tasks — along with their respective category and emoji — are saved here in a structured format for easy reference and persistent storage.
This file acts as the central source of truth for your task list and updates dynamically as you add or delete tasks through the CLI.
